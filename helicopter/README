This Helicopter model comes from the paper "Autonomous Autorotation of an RC Helicopter" by Pieter Abbell, Andrew Ng. Actually, I don't have the exact mathematic model of the Helicopter. However, I extract from the simulator from website "http://2013.rl-competition.org/domains/helicopter". The simulator is implemened by Java and is employed to support the competition of RL. Firstly, I get the Java model from this simulator and then a 'lua' version is replicated.
